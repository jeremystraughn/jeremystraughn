## Hi there 👋
## I'm a bit new to gh so even though public, this repo is a scratch pad (for now)
## This is a slightly edited version of the README.md on the main branch, just different enough to give the diff something to do.
## If I wanted, apparently I could pick out some things (formerly known as "emoticons") from here: https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/

## I added this picture so I could learn how to close an issue by creating and merging a pull request.  Note: be sure to write "closes #4" on its own line in the pull request description.
